This project is my final submission for NJIT’s CS634 Data Mining course. It focuses on predicting diabetes using three models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and an LSTM neural network. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset with 400 records. The Python script loads the data, handles missing values, standardizes features, and performs 10-fold cross-validation for all three models. It then prints evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, and also generates ROC curves. To run the project, install the required Python libraries and execute the script with the dataset in the same folder. The results show that Random Forest performed the best overall, followed by SVM and then LSTM. The repository includes the code, dataset, notebook, and full project report.
